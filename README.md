Sick kid, uh, sick bitch
Uh, really rappin', uh, I'm sick of it
I got ten cars in traffic, I went Ludacris
I feel it spillin' out my body, tryna do a bitch
These niggas can't step, baby, the shoe don't fit
I might go blonde my dreads, go blonde my tips
I might just empty my chamber, reload the clip
Relocate, oh, yeah, known to flip
Double-0-5, oh, yeah, don't set trip (Schyeah)
White bricks, schyeah (Schyeah, schyeah)
She on that co-co-co, trip, trip, uh-huh (Schyeah)

Feelin' like I was born richer, uh, just like Ricky Hil, uh-huh (Schyeah)
Still alive just like 50, yeah, uh-huh
Southside, bitch, yeah, Riverdale, uh-huh (Schyeah, schyeah)
Southside, bitch, yeah, Riverdale, uh-huh (Schyeah, schyeah)
